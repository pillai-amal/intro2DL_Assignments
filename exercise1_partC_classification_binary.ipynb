    "- Add and adapt your regression code (using numpy, not sklearn) from the previous exercise, so that is can predict the class label for each sample. This means, we treat the class of a point (0 or 1) as the target value of the regression. The linear regression will then yield us a formula that can give each (x, y) location a score, which class it might belong to. It's not a probability because it does not need to be between 0 and 1, but we can interpret a value being nearer to 0 as a higher probability for the class 0, and a value being nearer to 1 as a higher probability for class 1.\n",
